# Hand-Bone-Measurements
My Hand Bone Tkinter App I developed during my first co-op work term

The goal of this app was to measure the bone-gap ratios of immature hand bones in DICOM images.
I am extremely passionate about the reseearch I did over the summer as it directly related to scoliosis,
a spinal condition that I, and many others, believe is under researched.

I did not use GitHub as I made this, it definitely would have helped if I did!
For now, I have uploaded all of my versions and backups.
